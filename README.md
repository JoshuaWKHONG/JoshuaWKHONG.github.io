# Joshua Won Keon HONG
Welcome to my personal portfolio! 

## About Me
I’m a process engineer with more than 15 years of experience in Oil & Gas industry.
I recently completed Junior Data Engineer course at Generation Singapore and seeking for the role of Data Engineer and Data Analyst.

## Career Summary
With 15+ years of experience, I worked with process data, simulation tools (HYSYS, Pro-II, Aspen Plus), and analytics platforms (KNIME, Power BI) to improve performance and strengthen system accuracy. Skilled in Python and SQL to design and build data pipelines, I have strong analytical and problem-solving skills,and I’m comfortable turning raw data into clear insights.
My experience taught me how to validate data, troubleshoot issues and build structured workflows. I work well with cross-functional teams and can translate technical details into simple steps. Now I’m looking to move into a data role where I can apply these skills to build data workflows and support data-driven decisions.

## Tech Skills
- Programming Languages: Python, SQL 
- Data Warehouse & Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- Cloud Platforms: Azure, Microsoft Fabric
- Data Processing & Analysis Tools: Microsoft Power BI, KNIME
- GitHub & Git

## Projects
### Analysis of Olist data
- Data cleaning, wrangling, analysis, and visualization of data from Brazilian ecommerce platform, Olist, using Python, SQL, Microsoft Fabric and Microsoft Power BI 
- Medallion Architecture implemented in Microsoft Fabric platform and OLAP database based on galaxy schema established
- A highly negative relationship between delivery performance(average delay days) and customer satisfaction(average review score) with correlation coefficient r = -0.98
- This finding supports the hypothesis "As delivery variance increases, customer review scores will systematically decrease"
